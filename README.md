# School_District_Analysis

# Purpose
The school board requested we take a look at some of the highschools in the district and perfom some analysis to see if there was anything of importance that stood out. In our tabular data we have rows and columns. The columns consist of math and reading scores, budgets, and the schools. the school bpard instructed we conduct an anlysis first with all data and then another with taking out 9th grade data for Thomas High School.

# Results

The data for Thomas High Scool has changed 90.94% to 90.63% after removing all the 9th graders.
## How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
There is defintely a differnece in overall passing but not by much.
## How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following: Math and reading scores by grade
There is no change because the value in 9th grade now shows NaN.
## Scores by school spending
The numbers are not affected because of the 9th grade data
## Scores by school size
Once again no change in data due to 9th grade data being absent
## Scores by school type
Still no change in data with 9thgrade data being Null
## Conclusion
It is safe to say that removing the 9th grade data from Thomas Hgih School had no overall affect on the outcome of the data based on what we were asked to look for.
